<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Food and Beverage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pumps for Food and Beverage market primarily features two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are designed to move fluids by converting rotational energy into hydrodynamic energy, making them ideal for low-viscosity liquids like water or sugar solutions. Conversely, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of liquid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for viscous fluids such as sauces or syrups. Each type serves specific applications within the industry, ensuring efficient liquid handling.</p></p>
